# Generate Graders from Data

Automatically create evaluation graders from labeled data instead of manually designing criteria. The system learns evaluation rubrics by analyzing what makes responses good or bad in your dataset.

!!! tip "Key Benefits"
    - **Save time** — Eliminate manual rubric design
    - **Data-driven** — Learn criteria from actual examples
    - **Consistent** — Produce reproducible evaluation standards
    - **Scalable** — Quickly prototype graders for new domains


## What is a Rubric?

A **rubric** is a set of evaluation criteria that guides the LLM judge on how to score responses. Instead of asking the LLM to "rate this response," you provide specific criteria like:

```
Theme: Accuracy
- Tip: The response should contain factually correct information
- Tip: Claims should be verifiable and not contradict established knowledge

Theme: Completeness  
- Tip: The response should address all parts of the question
- Tip: Important details should not be omitted
```

**Why rubrics matter:**

- Without rubrics, LLM judges are inconsistent and subjective
- With rubrics, evaluations become reproducible and explainable
- The challenge: manually writing good rubrics is time-consuming and requires domain expertise

**The solution:** Auto-Rubric automatically extracts these criteria from your labeled data.


## How It Works

Auto-Rubric extracts evaluation rubrics from preference data without training. Based on [Auto-Rubric: Learning to Extract Generalizable Criteria for Reward Modeling](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.17314).

**Two-stage approach:**

1. **Infer query-specific rubrics** — For each labeled example, the system proposes criteria that explain why one response is better than another
2. **Generalize to core set** — Similar rubrics are merged and organized into a compact, non-redundant "Theme-Tips" structure

**Data efficiency:** Using just 70 preference pairs, this method enables smaller models to match or outperform fully-trained reward models.

## When to Use This Approach

Suppose you have a dataset of query-response pairs with quality labels (scores or rankings), and you want to create a grader that can evaluate new responses using the same criteria.

!!! tip "Use Data-Driven Generation When"
    - You have labeled evaluation data (preference pairs or scored responses)
    - Manual rubric design is too time-consuming or subjective
    - Your evaluation criteria are implicit and hard to articulate

!!! warning "Don't Use When"
    - You have no labeled data
    - Your criteria are already well-defined and documented
    - Simple Code-Based evaluation is sufficient


## Choose Your Evaluation Mode

| Mode | Config Class | Use Case | Data Format | Output |
|------|--------------|----------|-------------|--------|
| **Pointwise** | `IterativePointwiseRubricsGeneratorConfig` | Score individual responses (e.g., 1-5 rating) | `label_score` | `score`, `reason` |
| **Listwise** | `IterativeListwiseRubricsGeneratorConfig` | Rank multiple responses (e.g., A > B > C) | `label_rank` | `ranking`, `reason` |

In the following example, we'll use **Pointwise** mode to build a code explanation grader.


## Complete Example: Build a Code Review Grader (Pointwise)

Let's walk through a complete example: building a grader that evaluates code explanation quality.

### Step 1: Prepare Labeled Data

```python
dataset = [
    {
        "query": "Explain what this Python code does: `[x**2 for x in range(10)]`",
        "response": "This is a list comprehension that creates a list of squares from 0 to 81. It iterates through numbers 0-9 and squares each one.",
        "label_score": 5  # Excellent: accurate, complete, clear
    },
    {
        "query": "Explain what this Python code does: `lambda x: x * 2`",
        "response": "It's a function.",
        "label_score": 2  # Poor: too brief, missing key details
    },
    {
        "query": "Explain what this Python code does: `dict.get(key, default)`",
        "response": "This method retrieves a value from a dictionary. If the key exists, it returns the associated value. If not, it returns the default value instead of raising a KeyError.",
        "label_score": 5  # Excellent: explains behavior and edge case
    },
    {
        "query": "Explain what this Python code does: `async def fetch(): ...`",
        "response": "This defines an asynchronous function named fetch.",
        "label_score": 3  # Okay: correct but lacks depth
    },
    # ... more examples (recommend 50-100)
]
```

### Step 2: Configure and Run the Generator

```python
import asyncio
from rm_gallery.core.generator.iterative_rubric.generator import (
    IterativeRubricsGenerator,
    IterativePointwiseRubricsGeneratorConfig
)
from rm_gallery.core.generator.iterative_rubric.query_rubric_generator import (
    POINTWISE_EVALUATION_TEMPLATE
)
from rm_gallery.core.models import OpenAIChatModel

async def main():
    # Configure the generator
    config = IterativePointwiseRubricsGeneratorConfig(
        grader_name="code_explanation_grader",
        model=OpenAIChatModel(model="qwen3-32b"),
        custom_evaluation_prompt=POINTWISE_EVALUATION_TEMPLATE,
        min_score=1,
        max_score=5,
        query_specific_generate_number=2,
        enable_categorization=True,
        categories_number=3
    )

    # Generate the grader
    generator = IterativeRubricsGenerator(config)
    grader = await generator.generate(dataset)
    
    return grader

grader = asyncio.run(main())
```

### Step 3: Inspect the Generated Rubrics

After generation, you can inspect the learned rubrics (stored in `grader.kwargs`):

```python
print(grader.kwargs.get("rubrics"))
```

**Output (Generated Rubrics):**

```
Rubric 1:
Theme: Correct Identification and Explanation of Code Type and Purpose
- Tip1: Accurately identifies the type of Python code (e.g., list comprehension, lambda function, asynchronous function) and explains its purpose.
- Tip2: Provides a basic explanation of what the code does, such as generating a list of squared numbers or doubling an input.

Rubric 2:
Theme: Detailed Functional Understanding and Contextual Clarity
- Tip1: Describes the range of values processed by the code and the resulting output values.
- Tip2: Includes additional context or examples that clarify how the code operates in practice, such as explaining `dict.get()` behavior or providing usage examples for lambda functions.

Rubric 3:
Theme: Depth of Explanation for Advanced Concepts
- Tip1: Explains advanced features like asynchronous execution using `async def`, non-blocking behavior, and typical use cases (e.g., with `await` or event loops).
- Tip2: Clearly differentiates between correct and incomplete explanations, assigning higher scores for depth and accuracy.
```

These rubrics are automatically injected into the evaluation prompt when the grader runs.

### Step 4: Evaluate New Responses

Now use the grader to evaluate new code explanations:

```python
async def evaluate_new_response():
    result = await grader.aevaluate(
        query="Explain what this Python code does: `map(str, [1, 2, 3])`",
        answer="The map function applies str to each element in the list, converting integers to strings. The result is a map object that yields '1', '2', '3' when iterated."
    )
    print(result)

asyncio.run(evaluate_new_response())
```

**Output:**

```python
GraderScore(
    name='code_explanation_grader',
    score=4.0,
    reason="The response correctly identifies the code as using the `map` function and accurately explains its purpose of converting integers to strings. It also describes the resulting output as a map object that yields string values when iterated, which demonstrates functional understanding. However, it lacks additional context or examples (e.g., how to convert the map object into a list for immediate use) that could further clarify how the code operates in practice, slightly limiting its depth."
)
```

### Step 5: Compare Good vs. Bad Responses

```python
# Evaluate a poor response
result = await grader.aevaluate(
    query="Explain what this Python code does: `map(str, [1, 2, 3])`",
    answer="It maps things."
)
print(result)
```

**Output:**

```python
GraderScore(
    name='code_explanation_grader',
    score=1.0,
    reason="The response 'It maps things.' is extremely vague and lacks any meaningful explanation of what the code does. It fails to identify the type of Python code (e.g., the use of the `map` function), explain its purpose, describe the transformation applied, or provide any contextual clarity. The explanation is insufficient and does not meet even the most basic criteria for understanding or explaining the code."
)
```
